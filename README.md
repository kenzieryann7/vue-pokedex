# Pokédex Database

Disclaimer: I created this database as a way to practice my coding skills.

### A Pokédex site using Vue and Bootstrap 5.

I originally created this Pokédex Database of Generation 1 Pokémon as an assignment for a class. I added more content such as being able to view more info about the selected Pokémon. The user has the ability to filter by name or Pokédex number in either ascending or descending order. Also, they can use the search bar to quickly look up a Pokémon.
